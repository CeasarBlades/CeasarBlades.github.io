<h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
<p> I'm a pilot by profession and since COVID-19 has caused the collapse of international travel, the next year or so will be spent building up different sets of skills to compliment the ones i have so far. I'm currently serving in military, an during that time i have also completed Cybersecurity and Blockchain Certification, and the biggest skill that I'm missing is coding i have requested that i take time off from the miltary for the next 3 months to really focus Dev academy and build solid programming skills. This will compliment my Cybersecurity and Blockain experience, this will also be an asset to the organizations i'll be working for.</p>
<h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
<p>I have acquired afew over my career and here afew that is engrained in my DNA as a Pilot and serve in the military,
LEADERSHIP AND COMMAND- confidence without arrogance, use of authority to create a " challenge and response atmosphere. Motivates through appreciation, coaches where necessary. Stays composed, positive, and unflappable even in adverse conditions. Adjust communication style to audience and situation.
 
TEAMWORK- Establishes atmosphere for open communication, Encourages inputs and feedback from others. Listens and ask questions. Does not compete with others. Shares key information Empowers others. Support team decision-making. Proactively deals with conflict.
* You have to speak up, whether you're second /first/ or Captain involve everyone and know everything about the plane/operation/ SOP/ Emergency/ fly the aircraft like the pilot in command and be aggressive and jump right into it or get your hands dirty only way to learn quick..and don't be afraid to make mistakes.*

DECISION MAKING- takes decisive action if required, clearly states goals, focussed. gathers information to identify a problem, evaluates, states alternative options and considers risk, listens for understanding, agrees to action, implements, Re-evaluates, and modifies if needed

WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT- tasks are shared and delegated, sets priorities, allocates adequate time to complete tasks, sensitive to signs of stress and fatigue, deals with stress

HONESTY AND INTEGRITY- take responsibility. admit to mistakes, open about shortcomings, address the "hard stuff." build credibility, trust, and respect.
   </p>
<h2>Commitment</h2>
<p>I fully appreciate and understand the magnitude of committing to this programming bootcamp, as i have requested that i take 3 months off from my current job, and as i mentioned this is to compliment my Blockchain and Cybersecurity certs. I value what I'll be learning here as its an important skill im my repertoire.</p>

<h2> Seeking Help and Expectations</h2>
<p> This is a very new and different field for me, so i will be slow when starting off and maybe even lost with some things. But with new things that you are learning, it takes time and practice. I always use the analogy from flight school as in your first day at flight school i never thought i'd fly the biggest planes on earth on my first day at flight school. But through hours of hard work, it's a piece of cake for me to fly them big planes. So im taking the same attitude into Dev academy, i know i'll need help along the way but i also know that it takes a lot of hard work to archive something.</p>
