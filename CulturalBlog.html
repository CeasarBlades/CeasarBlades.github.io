<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence? </h2>
<p>
    For me emotional intelligence means having the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, 
    empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. This is highly effective when you're in a management role when you're dealing with different types of personalities, 
    cultures and different views. An important factor is that for the majority of people it depends on your 
    environment when you grew up, this factor has a great effect on emotional intelligence. If the child is nurtured in an 
    environment where it is taught and sees emotional awareness, then this will increasingly encourage a higher EQ.
</p>



<h2> How is it different to IQ?</h2>
<p>
    IQ, is a number derived from a standardized intelligence test,
    Emotional intelligence refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.
</p>


<h2> Why is it important?</h2>
<p>
    A high EQ helps individuals to communicate better, reduce their anxiety and stress, defuse conflicts, 
    improve relationships, empathize with others, and effectively overcome life's challenges. Our emotional intelligence affects the quality of our lives 
    because it influences our behavior and relationships.

<h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
<p>
    Neuroplasticity has an amazing relation to learning. when we learn, we form new pathways in the brain. 
    Each new lesson has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain’s default mode of operation.
    Of course, not all learning is created equal—learning new facts does not necessarily take advantage of the amazing neuroplasticity of the brain, but learning a new language or a musical instrument certainly does. It is through this sort of learning 
    that we may be able to figure out how to purposefully rewire the brain.
    The extent to which we apply the brain’s near-magical abilities is also dependent on how 
    invested we are in promoting neuroplasticity and how we approach life in general.
</p>

<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

<p> 
    I first learned about Growth Mindset at flight school, 
    it is one of the most important part of being a pilot when your first starting of your
    journey in Aviation. So to come across this in Web Development is a breath of 
    fresh air i can relate too. Basically a person with a growth mindset believes that he 
    or she will get smarter, better, or more skilled at something through sustained 
    effort—which is exactly what neuroplasticity tells us. In Aviation, we 
    interrupt growth minset as, if doesnt matter if fail in your first attempt but through
    practise and trial and error your brain will start develop path ways and connect 
    new neurons and thats how learning occurs. Knowing this is like absolutly gold when trying archive your 
    goals and objective.
</p>


<h2>Intergrating Both For Learning Development</h2>
<p>
    The most important thing is to realise that its benefitial for your personal growth 
    and helps with you knowing how the brain works. I personally can vouch for this technique
    as we use this in Aviation toteach pilots not only at entry level but at the highest level of 
    flying this is incorporated into our learning. I havent come across this technique of leaning in the military but it will benefit the organization for 
    teaching and upgrading there teaching techniques.
