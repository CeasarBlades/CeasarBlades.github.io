<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence? </h2>
<p>For me emotional intelligence means having the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. This is highly effective when you're in a management role when you're dealing with different types of personalities, cultures and different views. 
 
An important factor is that for the majority of people it depends on your environment when you grew up, this factor has a great effect on emotional intelligence. If the child is nurtured in an environment where it is taught and sees emotional awareness, then this will increasingly encourage a higher EQ. </p>
