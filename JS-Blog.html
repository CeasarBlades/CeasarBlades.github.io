<h2>HTML and CSS analogy</h2>

<p>The way I would describe HTML and CSS to my little cousin, is describing both of them as lego blocks. Where the blocks themselves are the HTML, and CSS would be the different colored blocks or the different shaped blocks. Now to build a project or a website, its pretty much the same. You would use the blocks (HTML) to either create a dinosaur or a castle, but you'll need certain colored blocks (CSS) to colour the tail of the dinosaur or design the tower for the castle.</p>


<h2>Control Flow and Loops.</h2>
<p>First to describe in simple words to a friend what control flows does in programming, we can say it executes statements in a orderly fashion hence the name "control flow" allowing it to flow smoothly. one statement we use quiet often is the the if/else statement. When using this statement it will return an outcome based on the input, as shown in our diagram of the flow chart.</p>

<p>Describing Loops a simple way is that its function is to evaluate expressions over and over again until it either returns what we are looking for, or stops after a certain time. This is shown in the diagram below</p>

<h2>DOM and interactions with the DOM.</h2>
<p>The DOM is a like window into a website, as you look into this window you'll see the inner workings and structures of how the whole website works. You can not only look into to this window, but you can reach in and make adjustments inside this window which has an effect on the website. Now that is a oversimplied exaplanation of the DOM to my 5 year old cousin, but this is actually what the DOM is for. Basically a interface for developers to peer into the inner workings of a website, and make adjustments as required or to run design for a element of the website</p>

<h2>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects.</h2>
<p>To my 5 year old cousin I would describe Objects as “things” like person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics, while Arrays create and store lists of data (like a shopping list). To access these we can use both dot and bracket notation in our computer which allows us to add, change, and remove items from an object, while for the arrays we can use numbers from 0-9 allows us access and alter items in an array. To summarize to my little cousin access objects we use dots and brackets and access arrays we use numers 0-9.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Fuction is proberly one of the most important feature in building a website, its a statement that performs a task and calculates a value depending on the input. For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else. To my little cousin this would mean, logging into there playstation with their password and returns with a message of 'Welcome little cousin' or 'Incorrect Password'. </p>
