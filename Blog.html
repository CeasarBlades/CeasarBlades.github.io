<h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>

<p>
    In simple terms all 3 have similar properties of adding or reducing 
    thickness or space around a feature on a website.
</p>

<p> 
    We will start with margins - it is used to create space between the edges of a feature or element from another. It can have different 
    combinations with its width and height to give the user or developer the size they want.

<p>  
    Next we will look at boarders - It is a way of styling elements, 
    it can solid lines, dashed or dotted borders around an element to give it abit of focus from 
    the user.

<p> 
    Finally we have Padding - as the name suggests, it is a feature which uses space between 
    the container and content. This space between the content and container can be increased and 
    decresed in all direction.
</p>

<p>
    Final thoughts, all 3 are very usefull not only in creating space, 
    but also a great tool to direct the users attention to a element or feature eg. payment methods, 
    special deals, upcoming events and so on.
