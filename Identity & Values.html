<h2> Ethical Decision</h2>
<p> 
    I work in an highly stressfull enviroment, where one mistake can snowball 
    into a disater not only in flying but also operational wise on the ground. 
    There are endless instances everyday, where you have to make the call as a pilot 
    in command, that could impact alot of lives. A certain flight we operated on
    experienced mechical difficulties in flight on our way to the destination, 
    once we landed at our destination we had our engineers have a look at it and it
    was determined that our return flight can be conducted and at a very high risk 
    that it might fail inflight again. Based on this information, management which 
    understanderably want revenue or money coming into the airline, 
    well in simple words tried to make us fly this aircraft on minimum safety to
    make alittle bit of money putting aside the lives of hundreds on that plane for 
    the greed of a few man. We sat down as a crew, and decided that the lives of 
    300 were worth more, and more important than a piece of paper that people call money. 
    We didnt conduct the flight, but had a screaming match with our managers when we got back to our base. </p>

<h2> Culture Influence on Values and Identity</h2>
<p> 
    My upbringing is having the best of 2 worlds, i grew up in Fiji til i was 14 years 
    old where christianity and respecting your tradition, family, community, and sports
    was normal. Then we imigrated to NZ as my dad was offered a job as a engineer in 
    Wellington, where i went to Wellington College. Going to Wellington college was 
    proberly the best thing for transitioning into NZ culture. It had NZ tradition, 
    family, and sports values which were the same as the first part of my life, but
    most importantly for me it taught me to be competitive and think for yourself an 
    think on your own. This i think, influenced me in the career path i took where i 
    choose to be a pilot and be in the military, they are both highly competitive 
    industries where you are always trying to be the better version of yourself by
    putting in the hard work and striving to be the best at what you do.

<h2> Strenths and Limitations</h2>
<p> 
    This is a summary of the Strengths and limitation from my blog that has been 
    engrained into my DNA from my background. 
</p>
<ul class=".a">
    <li>Leadership and Command</li>
    <li>Teamwork</li>
    <li>Decision Making</li>
    <li>Honesty and integrity</li>
  </ul>
<p>
    There always limitation to a persons ability, it is a natural part of human 
    pychology and that list is a long one for me, but a key one for me is 
    balancing my projects in other words i'll be immersed into completing Dev Academy,
    which is not a bad thing but you start neglecting other stuff. So its good 
    to have a balanced work and pplay or party time.
</p>
    
  <h2>Personality Test</h2>

<p>
    As a pilot we constantly test for pychological reasoning throughout our careers 
    by a pychologist, but one main personality that the aviation industry look for
    is someone who is confident to speak up in dangerous situation and alittle 
    extravert and that refelcts on the Myers Briggs test which show im Assertive 
    Protagonist.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tolerant</li>
    <li>Reliable</li>
    <li>Charismatic</li>
    <li>Natural Leader</li>
  </ul>
