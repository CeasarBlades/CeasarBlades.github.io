  <h2>A problem of "Astronomical" proportian</h2>
  <img src = "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/25/2020/04/Things-never-knew-astronomy-e454e5d.jpg?quality=90&resize=768%2C574" alt="solarflare">
  
  <p>
      A massive problem i came across this week was my inability to put my understanding into code, 
      what i found was that i could understand most of the concepts and fundamentals of Javascript where i understood 
      what a function is, a array or a boolean. But when it came to next step of applying that understanding into code, i came up blank. 
  </p>
  <h2>Example.</h2>
  <p>
      A good example of this was the Manipulatin JS Objects execise, i 
      clearly understand the fundamentals but when presented with a task like this one  
      typeof terah.children.ben === 'object'
      I was completely blank.
  </p>
  <h2>Tackling the Problem</h2>
  <p>
      So i used what I've learnt in my background, but i found that i may need to 
      tweek afew of the steps and concepts of my problem solving. 
      But none the less the fundamentals of problem solving skill just needs abit of 
      adjustment to different disciplines or industry. So Ive picked a few that are 
      really esseential for programming and they are listed below.
  </p>
  <h2>Techniques Used</h2>
  <p>
      Google - Is my main source of information, but there is always a risk that you could easily fall into a rabbit hole when 
      searching for resources on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
      Facilitator - at this early stage i really want dive into the deep end and learn, but once ive exhausted my options then its always a good hand to
      ask for help from my facilitator. This not only solves afew problems but also reduces the amount of hours wasted on a 1 line of code.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Point to Takeaway</h2>
  <p>
      Important take away for me, is my technical ability and that comes with time, the more i immerse myself into the field the
      understanding and it will help me look at the problem from a different point of view. 
</p>
  <h1>Different Methods to Problem Solving </h1>

    <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
  <p>
      My understanding of pseudocode is basically a written recipe or steps
      about constructing steps to solve a problem. The classic example i could use to explain this my non-technical mate, would be think of pseudocode as a recipe to bake a pizza. Example
      1. get some flour, 2. get salt, 3. get the yeast and so on... Until you've complete the recipe or task, 
      so it's basically recipe to your work. Pretty much like a comment.
  </p>

  <h2>Trying something</h2>
  <p> 
      Trying something is my second most used form of problem solving after coming up with a plan.
  </p>

  <h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
  <p>
      In aviation we use a similar method called Feynman technique, instead of talking to a duck, its always
      good to explain to yourself or try explaining what your trying to solve to a 5 year old. When explaing the problem or concept to 
      a 5 year old in simple terms. This not only helps with your understanding it also helps with you breaking the problem into smaller steps. 
  </p>
    <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
    <p>
        I didnt really use this technique to its full potential, which i proberly should in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Console.logging</h2>
    <p>
        Really should make this a habit with console logging and making sure my code works, a tool I'm sure i will use a billion times
        in the future when I'm using Javascript. 
    </p>

    <h2>Googling</h2>
    <p>
        My most trusted source or information, but as stated above this can lead to many hours wasted when searching
        for the wrong information or literally reaserching information that leads you to different direction. 
    </p>

    <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
    <p>
        Main uses for this was asking peers for feed back on blog posts.
    </p>

    <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
    <p>
        My third used source of solving a problem, as I mentioned greatly reduces 
        time spent unecesaryliy browsing google. When i do ask its straight to the point.
    </p>

    <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
    <p>
        This proberly the most underrated type of problem solving, i really like this step because once i've solved a line of code i can good back through the process and
        reflect of what, how, and where i went wrong.
