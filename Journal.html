  <h2>3 Lessons learnt from this section on the Solar Sytem</h2>
      <p>
          Distraction , Discipline, Acknowledgement. With distraction I came to the realization when im deep in a rabbit hole with a task, 
          is because im distracted with the searches i have made on a task. eg if i search "how to access arrays" the videos on wethe amount of web pages that come up 
          is definitly a distraction. As with Discipline been given a task and going over the allocated time, 
          this comes with experience and competence with a software programming. Third and most importantly is Acknowledgement that it's 
          ok to not know everything, it took awhile for me to accept it, but developing the developing fundamentals, tools and skills to complete or solve
          a problem.
      </p>
  
  <h2>Values, Empathy and Self Awareness</h2>
      <p>
          Values and empathy with self awareness is key for my progress, and this is detailed in
          my Identity and Values Blog. But also, adding to my Identity and Values Blog, my values of 
          hardwork and integrity has taught me to be resilient when in a challenging task, and learning a new field
          with Dev Academy is certainly a challenging task. Goinf through foundation and the first phase of bootcamp I have
          learnt much more already about my learning skills and also having empathy when working in a team enviroment is key. I have understood that people can be technically gifted but if they
          dont understand team chemistry or dynamics and learning about strengths and weaknesses of a team to complete a task. I look forward to the rest of bootcamp and super exicited about building more skills.

  <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
        A pleasant surprise with core learning was coming across Neuroplastic and growth mindset.
        Important fundamentals in have the structure of your mindset set for a challenging task.
      
    </p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        I love core learning because it lays the foundation for your brain and mindset with anything your learning
        or anything your attempting in life.
      </p>

  <h2>Should we or Shouldn't we ?</h2>
    <p>
       I trust that all instructors in the school have experienced mental blockades in your programing careers, and implenting this in the course for a challenging course 
       is proberly the best thing about it. This school doesnt only teach technical stuff but also the understanding
       of ones ability and abiliity and limitts and awareness that it is ok to have blockades in your programming career. But its all about
       learning about yourself and putting structures down for your programming career.
    </p>

  <h2>Is it Core worth the Time or is it Worth it in Gold</h2>

    <p>
      No i think Core is the best thing about this course, it not only teaches for progamming but
      also other discipline, the skills you gain is absolute gold.
